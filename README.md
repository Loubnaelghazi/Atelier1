## Objective <a name="objective"></a>

The main purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with web scraping techniques using libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup, and to implement a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text data obtained from Arabic web sources.

## Overview of Work <a name="overview-of-work"></a>

1. **Web Scraping :**
   - Utilized Scrapy and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape data from ALJAZERA web site (news).
   - Extracted article titles, links, and summaries for further analysis.

2. **Storing Data :**
   - Stored the raw scraped data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for future analysis.

3. **NLP Pipeline :**
   - Implemented a pipeline for text preprocessing, including cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, and normalization.
   - Applied stemming and lemmatization techniques to reduce words to their root forms and compared their effectiveness.
   - Used both rule-based and machine learning-based parts of speech tagging techniques.
   - Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify and classify named entities in the text data.

1. **Clone the repository :**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Loubnaelghazi/Atelier1/edit/main/README.md

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
Through this project, I have learned valuable skills in web scraping and natural language processing. I gained hands-on experience with data collection, text preprocessing, linguistic analysis, and database management. This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of how to extract, preprocess, and analyze textual data from Arabic web sources, which will be beneficial for future projects and research endeavors.
