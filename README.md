Objective <a name="objective"></a>

The main purpose of this project is to gain familiarity with web scraping techniques using libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup, and to implement a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text data obtained from Arabic web sources.
Overview of Work <a name="overview-of-work"></a>

    Web Scraping :
        Utilized Scrapy and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape data from Arabic web sources related to a specific domain.
        Extracted article titles, links, and summaries for further analysis.

    Storing Data :
        Stored the raw scraped data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for future retrieval and analysis.

    NLP Pipeline :
        Implemented a pipeline for text preprocessing, including cleaning, tokenization, stop words removal, and normalization.
        Applied stemming and lemmatization techniques to reduce words to their root forms and compared their effectiveness.
        Used both rule-based and machine learning-based parts of speech tagging techniques.
        Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify and classify named entities in the text data.

Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

Through this project, I have learned valuable skills in web scraping and natural language processing. I gained hands-on experience with data collection, text preprocessing, linguistic analysis, and database management. This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of how to extract, preprocess, and analyze textual data from Arabic web sources, which will be beneficial for future projects and research endeavors.
