Objective:
The main purpose of this lab project is to gain familiarity with web scraping techniques using libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup, and to implement a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline for text data obtained from Arabic web sources.

Work Overview:

    Scraping: Utilized Scrapy and Beautiful Soup libraries to scrape data from Arabic web sources related to a specific domain.
    Storing Data: Stored the raw scraped data in a NoSQL database (MongoDB) for future analysis and processing.
    NLP Pipeline: Implemented text cleaning techniques, tokenization, stop words removal, and normalization to prepare the text for further analysis.
    Stemming and Lemmatization: Applied stemming and lemmatization techniques to reduce words to their root forms and compared their effectiveness.
    Parts of Speech Techniques: Applied rule-based and machine learning-based parts of speech tagging using NLTK and spaCy.
    NER Methods: Applied Named Entity Recognition (NER) methods to identify and classify named entities in the text data.

Conclusion:
Through this lab project, I gained hands-on experience with web scraping and NLP techniques, including text preprocessing, parts of speech tagging, and named entity recognition. Under the supervision of Pr. Elachak, this project provided practical insights into data acquisition, processing, and analysis, contributing to my understanding of both web scraping and NLP methodologies.
